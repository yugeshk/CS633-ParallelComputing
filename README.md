# Repository for CS633 Parallel Programming Fall 2019-20

This repository contains code I wrote as part of CS633 (Parallel Computing) using the MPI (message passing interface) framework for communication for parallel processes. It implements some of the standard send/receive algorithms and includes benchmarking for them.
